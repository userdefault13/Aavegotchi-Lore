## 🎯 How to Build a Scene

Since this is an MVP with scripts only, you'll need to create the scene manually:

### 1. Create Main Scene

1. **Create new scene**: File → New Scene → Basic (3D)
2. **Save scene**: `Assets/Scenes/GameScene.unity`

### 2. Setup Game Managers

Create empty GameObjects and attach scripts:

```
Hierarchy:
├── GameManager (GameManager.cs)
├── FieldManager (FieldManager.cs)
├── ScoreManager (ScoreManager.cs)
├── TeamManager (TeamManager.cs)
├── SeasonManager (SeasonManager.cs)
└── OpponentAI (OpponentAI.cs)
```

### 3. Create the Football Field

1. **Create Plane** (Ground): GameObject → 3D Object → Plane
   - Scale: (10, 1, 20)
   - Position: (0, 0, 0)
   - Add green material

2. **Create Ball Object**: GameObject → 3D Object → Sphere
   - Name: "Football"
   - Scale: (0.3, 0.4, 0.3)
   - Tag: "Football"
   - Add `FootballBehavior.cs`
   - Add Rigidbody component

### 4. Setup Players

**Quarterback:**
```
GameObject → 3D Object → Capsule
- Name: "Quarterback"
- Tag: "Player"
- Add: QuarterbackController.cs
- Add: PlayerController.cs
- Add: Rigidbody (freeze rotation)
```

**Receivers (create 3):**
```
GameObject → 3D Object → Capsule
- Name: "Receiver1", "Receiver2", "Receiver3"
- Tag: "Receiver"
- Add: ReceiverController.cs
- Add: Rigidbody (freeze rotation)
- Position them spread across the field
```

**Defenders (create 5-7):**
```
GameObject → 3D Object → Capsule
- Name: "Defender1", "Defender2", etc.
- Tag: "Defender"
- Add: DefenderAI.cs
- Add: Rigidbody (freeze rotation)
- Give different colored material (red)
```

### 5. Setup Camera

```
Main Camera:
- Position: (0, 25, -30)
- Rotation: (45, 0, 0)
- Projection: Perspective
```

### 6. Create UI Canvas

1. **Create Canvas**: GameObject → UI → Canvas
   - Canvas Scaler: Scale with Screen Size
   - Reference Resolution: 1920x1080

2. **Add UI Scripts**:
   - GameHUD.cs
   - MenuManager.cs
   - PlayCallingUI.cs

3. **Create UI Elements**:

**HUD Panel:**
```
Canvas/
├── HUD Panel
│   ├── PlayerScore (TextMeshProUGUI)
│   ├── OpponentScore (TextMeshProUGUI)
│   ├── QuarterText (TextMeshProUGUI)
│   ├── TimeText (TextMeshProUGUI)
│   ├── DownAndDistance (TextMeshProUGUI)
│   └── YardLine (TextMeshProUGUI)
```

**Main Menu Panel:**
```
Canvas/
├── MainMenuPanel
│   ├── Title (TextMeshProUGUI)
│   ├── PlayButton (Button)
│   └── QuitButton (Button)
```

**Play Calling Panel:**
```
Canvas/
├── PlayCallingPanel
│   ├── PassPlayButton (Button)
│   ├── RunPlayButton (Button)
│   ├── FieldGoalButton (Button)
│   └── PuntButton (Button)
```

**Pause Menu Panel:**
```
Canvas/
├── PauseMenuPanel
│   ├── ResumeButton (Button)
│   ├── RestartButton (Button)
│   └── MainMenuButton (Button)
```

**Game Over Panel:**
```
Canvas/
├── GameOverPanel
│   ├── GameOverTitle (TextMeshProUGUI)
│   ├── FinalScore (TextMeshProUGUI)
│   ├── PlayAgainButton (Button)

## 🏈 Game Rules

### Scoring
- **Touchdown**: 6 points (advance to opponent's endzone)
- **Extra Point**: 1 point (automatic after TD, 95% success)
- **Field Goal**: 3 points (kick through uprights)
- **Safety**: 2 points (tackle opponent in their endzone)

### Downs System
- 4 downs to advance 10 yards
- First down resets to 10 yards or distance to endzone
- 4th down options: Go for it, Punt, or Field Goal

### Game Flow
1. Each team starts with the ball at their 20-yard line
2. Offense has 4 downs to gain 10 yards
3. Scoring changes possession
4. Game ends after 4 quarters
5. Winner determined by final score

## 💡 Tips for Development

### Testing the Game
1. Create a simple test scene first
2. Add debug logs to verify systems work
3. Use Unity's Console for error checking
4. Test each component individually

### Debugging
- Use `Debug.Log()` extensively
- Check Rigidbody constraints (freeze rotation)
- Verify tags are set correctly
- Ensure UI references are connected

### Performance
- Keep AI simple for smooth gameplay
- Limit number of active defenders (5-7)
- Use object pooling for repeated objects
- Optimize physics calculations

### Making it Look Better
1. Add materials with team colors
2. Create simple stadium environment
3. Add yard line markers
4. Create scoreboard UI
5. Add particle effects for celebrations
